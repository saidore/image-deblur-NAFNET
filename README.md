# Image Deblurring with Modified NAFNet
This project implements a lightweight image deblurring system based on a modified NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation-Free Network). It restores sharp images from motion-blurred inputs using a fast and efficient deep learning model trained on the GoPro image deblurring dataset.

The goal was to find the best balance between image quality and compute cost, so the model can run even on limited GPUs.

This work is based on the NAFNet architecture and improves it through careful tuning of the model structure, loss functions, and training strategy
